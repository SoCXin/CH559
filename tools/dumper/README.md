## Usage

Please install Python 3.x and PyUSB first.

```
pip install pyusb
```

Then, plug your device and make sure it in **download mode**.

For Windows, use Zadig to substitude the driver of "USB Module".

Finally, run *dump.py* and wait until it is done. It would take much time, so please be patient.
